## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

### What Was Requested:
1. ✅ Remove stats system (exosphere/naval/military)
2. ✅ Remove fixed theater types (Exosphere/Naval/Land)
3. ✅ Add custom GM-created theaters
4. ✅ Add sub-healthbar system
5. ✅ Simplify combat (modifiers only)
6. ✅ Consolidate ALL commands to action-based pattern
7. ✅ Reduce command count ("Less commands! Less confusing!")

### What Was Delivered:
- **59% reduction in total commands** (34 → 14)
- **Complete stats system removal** - Combat now modifier-based only
- **Custom theater system** - GMs create theaters like "Pennsylvania", "Gulf", etc.
- **Sub-healthbar system** - Track individual fleets/armies/squads
- **Unified damage distribution** - Unassigned consumed first, then spills
- **Action-based commands** - Consistent pattern across ALL systems
- **Migration utilities** - Auto-migrate old wars when loaded
